This directory contains files used to package colognecoind/colognecoin-qt
for Debian-based Linux systems.

If you compile colognecoind/colognecoin-qt yourself, there are some
useful files here:

colognecoin: URI support
--------------------

colognecoin-qt.desktop  (Gnome / Open Desktop)
To install:
  sudo desktop-file-install colognecoin-qt.desktop
  sudo update-desktop-database

If you build yourself, you will either need to modify the paths in
the .desktop file or copy or symlink your colognecoin-qt binary to /usr/bin
and the ../../share/pixmaps/colognecoin128.png to /usr/share/pixmaps

colognecoin-qt.protocol (KDE)
